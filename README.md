# Major Project - Face-Mask-for-Class-III-Skeletal-Correction-With-Wear-Time-Analytics


• Class III skeletal malocclusion requires consistent force application and patient compliance for effective orthodontic treatment

• Traditional face mask therapy lacks real-time monitoring of wear duration and applied force

• This project develops a smart face mask system for Class III skeletal correction with wear time analytics

• The system integrates embedded hardware with an Android application for treatment monitoring

• Real-time force applied by the face mask is continuously measured

• Total wear duration is tracked to analyze patient compliance

• Doctors can manage patients and view detailed treatment data through the Android app

• Graphical analytics provide insights into wear-time and force trends

• Notifications alert mask wear and removal events

• Patient and treatment data are securely stored for clinical reference

• The solution supports data-driven decision-making and improves orthodontic treatment monitoring







<h2 style="color:#1E90FF;">📱 Login Screen – Mask Wear Analytics</h2>


• Provides secure authentication for users using email and password

• Allows role selection (Patient / Doctor) during login

• Acts as the entry point to access mask wear analytics and monitoring features

• Ensures only authorized users can access patient and treatment data








<h2 style="color:#2E8B57;">👤 Patient Monitoring Dashboard</h2>


• Displays patient profile details such as name, UID, and current status

• Shows BLE connection status with the ESP32 device

• Displays the last recorded force value from the face mask

• Provides real-time updates on device connectivity and mask usage

• Helps doctors quickly assess patient compliance and system status







<h2 style="color:#FF8C00;">⏱️ Mask Usage Duration Analytics</h2>



• Visualizes mask wear duration using Day, Week, and Month views

• Displays total hours the mask was worn over different time periods

• Helps analyze patient compliance trends over time

• Supports data-driven evaluation of treatment adherence







<h2 style="color:#8A2BE2;">📊 Real-Time Force Monitoring Graph</h2>


• Displays live force values applied by the face mask using a load cell

• Shows force trends over time in graphical form

• Indicates connection status with the monitoring device

• Helps doctors verify whether the applied force is within the required range

• Supports clinical decision-making by monitoring treatment effectiveness
