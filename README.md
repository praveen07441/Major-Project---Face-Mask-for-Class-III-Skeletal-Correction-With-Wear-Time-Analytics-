# Major Project - Face-Mask-for-Class-III-Skeletal-Correction-With-Wear-Time-Analytics


• Class III skeletal malocclusion requires consistent force application and patient compliance for effective orthodontic treatment
• Traditional face mask therapy lacks real-time monitoring of wear duration and applied force
• This project develops a smart face mask system for Class III skeletal correction with wear time analytics
• The system integrates embedded hardware with an Android application for treatment monitoring
• Real-time force applied by the face mask is continuously measured
• Total wear duration is tracked to analyze patient compliance
• Doctors can manage patients and view detailed treatment data through the Android app
• Graphical analytics provide insights into wear-time and force trends
• Notifications alert mask wear and removal events
• Patient and treatment data are securely stored for clinical reference
• The solution supports data-driven decision-making and improves orthodontic treatment monitoring
